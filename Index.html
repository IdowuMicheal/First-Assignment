    <!--Question 2-->
    I chose the University Of Leicester because of its great reputation among schools in the United Kingdom, of producing 
    students with adequate knowledge, skill, and attitude to be an agent of positive change. From my research, the course modules are 
    interesting because they are an extension of everything I was taught in my undergraduate studies. From my research, I understand 
    that the University Of Leicester master in computer science course offers varieties of knowledge and skill that are useful in many 
    subject areas. These features have made me choose the university. The United Kingdom is known for its reputation for offering 
    high-quality education for both local and international students. The degree obtained in the United Kingdom is recognized by the 
    whole world and graduates are well trained and imbibed with the required skill to deliver great results and make massive contributions to the home country at large. I am a well-behaved person with very positive morals and a law-abiding personality. I understand the country as a country with so much diversity in terms of people with 
    different age ranges, sex orientations, different races, tribes, and ethnicity. With all these, I am someone that treats everybody 
    equally irrespective or regardless of gender, age, tribe, race, language, and ethnicity. I am a very loveable person that loves meeting new people and putting smiles on their faces of people. These reasons have motivated me to choose the country as my destination of study. I can be reached via email in my application portal if you have any further questions.
